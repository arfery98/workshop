# ðŸŒŸ TailwindCSS + Astro Workshop

A hands-on workshop project using **Astro** and **Tailwind CSS** to build a modern, fast static website that follows Figma UI design

## ðŸš€ Objective
The goal of this project is to **transform Figma UI designs into fully functional websites**, ensuring accurate layout and component structure. Part of my self-learning in web development

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Reference
The design is based on [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1273571982885059508) with focus on the following:
- **Typography and Colors**: Following the design system from Figma
- **Layout and Components**: Ensuring precise spacing and responsiveness
- **Consistency**: Making small changes between prototype and implementation

## ðŸ§  What I learned
- Building a static website with Astro
- Styling using Tailwind utility classes
- Creating reusable components and layouts
- Translating the design prototype into a usable UI

## ðŸ›  Installation
